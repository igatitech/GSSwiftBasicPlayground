# GSSwiftBasicPlayground

**Swift tour Examples**

Swift is the recommended programming language for writing iOS apps. The Swift language is more stable and mature.

## Let's execute Swift tour in Playground.
- Xcode has a built-in feature called Playground.
- It's an interactive development environment for developers to experiment Swift programming and allows you to see the result of your code immediately.

## How to work with Playground?

- To begin with, open the Xcode app: Click on the "Get started with a playground"

![alt text](https://github.com/igatitech/GSSwiftBasicPlayground/blob/master/Resources/WelcomeToXcode.png)

- You'll then be prompted to select a template for your playground. Choose Blank under the iOS section to create a blank file. Click Next to continue.

- Once you confirm to save the file, Xcode opens the Playground interface. Your screen should like this:

- On the left hand side, it is showing the editor area. When you want to check the outcome of your code, hit the play button as shown in the above picture. 

-  Playground immediately interprets the code (up to the line of the Play button) and displays the result on the right pane.

## Key Features:
1. Constants & Variables
2. Multiline String
3. Array & Dictionary
4. Optional Value
5. Switches
6. Control Flow
7. Functionas and Closures
8. Tuples
9. Higher Order Functions
10. Objects & Classes
11. Enumerations & Structures
12. Error Handling
13. Use of Defer
14. Generics

## How to run the project?
- Download or Clone the project
- Open .playground file from your project folder.
- Run the project from Xcode as explained above.

## Ackowledgement
- In this project I have written some code in Playground which is mentioned on Apple's Swift Tour Guidlines.
- Please remember, the purpose of this exercise is to let you experience Swift Programming and learn it's basic.
- This project will not cover every features of Swift but it will clear some of the basic fundamentals of Swift Programming Language.

**Happy Coding! Cheers!!** ðŸ¥‚
